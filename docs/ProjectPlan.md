# AI Pipeline Project Plan for Player Jersey Number Detection and Classification

## 1. Data Analysis
- **Objective**: Understand the structure, quantity, and quality of the data
- **Tasks**:
  - Analyze JSON annotation file structure
  - Count the number of frames and players per frame
  - Analyze the distribution of player jersey numbers
  - Check annotation quality and the clarity of jersey numbers

## 2. Data Processing and Preparation for Object Detection
- **Objective**: Convert data to YOLO format
- **Tasks**:
  - Write script to extract individual frames from videos
  - Convert annotations from COCO to YOLO format
  - Organize data according to standard YOLO directory structure
  - Split data into train/val sets

## 3. Train Object Detection Model
- **Objective**: Accurately detect player (and ball) positions
- **Tasks**:
  - Set up Ultralytics (YOLOv11)
  - Configure appropriate training parameters
  - Conduct training and monitor the process
  - Evaluate and improve model performance

## 4. Data Preparation for Image Classification
- **Objective**: Create a dataset for jersey number classification
- **Tasks**:
  - Crop player images based on bounding boxes
  - Label each image with jersey number
  - Analyze and balance the distribution of jersey number classes
  - Organize into train/val sets

## 5. Train Image Classification Model
- **Objective**: Accurately recognize player jersey numbers
- **Tasks**:
  - Design CNN architecture or use pretrained models
  - Configure training process (learning rate, batch size, augmentation)
  - Train the model and monitor the process
  - Evaluate and improve performance

## 6. Pipeline Integration
- **Objective**: Build complete pipeline from video to jersey number recognition results
- **Tasks**:
  - Write script to link the two models
  - Optimize processing speed
  - Display results visually

## 7. Evaluation and Improvement
- **Objective**: Ensure accuracy and performance
- **Tasks**:
  - Evaluate the entire pipeline on the test set
  - Identify weaknesses and make improvements
  - Experiment with advanced methods

## 8. Solve Bonus Task (if time permits)
- **Objective**: Build a multi-task model
- **Tasks**:
  - Design a model that classifies both jersey numbers and jersey colors
  - Adjust data and labels accordingly
  - Train and evaluate performance
