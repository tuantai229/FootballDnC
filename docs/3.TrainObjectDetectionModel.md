### Evaluation:

1. **Training time**: ~16 minutes for 50 epochs (0.272 hours)

2. **Detection results**:
   - **Player**: Good with precision 0.879, recall 0.819, mAP50 of 0.896
   - **Ball**: Not detected (precision 1.0 but recall 0 and mAP 0)
   - **Overall**: mAP50 reached 0.448 and mAP50-95 reached 0.214


### Issues to fix
Cannot detect the ball. Possible causes:
- Ball size is too small in 3840x1200 images when resized to 640x640
- Number of ball samples (170) is much less than player samples (869)

-----
## Training with improved script 1: src/detection/train_improve1.py

### Improvements

#### 1. Increase image size
- **imgsz=1280**: Increased from 640 to 1280 to retain more details, especially for small balls
- **batch=8**: Reduced batch size to accommodate GPU memory when processing larger images

#### 2. Adjust loss weights
- **box=7.5**: Kept the same weight for box loss
- **cls=0.5**: Kept the same weight for class loss

#### 3. Enable augmentation
- **fliplr=0.5**: Horizontal flip with 50% probability to increase data diversity
- **scale=0.5**: Change image scale to train the model to recognize objects at different sizes
- **mosaic=1.0**: Combine 4 images into 1 to increase diversity and object density

#### 4. Optimization for Mac M2
- **workers=2**: Reduced worker threads to avoid system overload
- **half=True**: Use half precision (FP16) to speed up training

### Evaluation:

- Script stopped at epoch 22/50 due to Early Stopping mechanism
- Best model saved at epoch 7

Results show some improvements but issues remain:

|            | Basic (640) | Improved (1280) |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| mAP50      | 0.448       | 0.468           |
| mAP50-95   | 0.214       | 0.290           |
| Player mAP | 0.428       | 0.580           |
| Ball mAP   | 0.000       | 0.000           |

**Main conclusion**: Model improves player detection but still **cannot detect the ball**.

-----
## Training with improved script 2: src/detection/train_improve2.py

### Improvements

1. Adjust class balance
```python
# [ball_weight, player_weight] - ball:5.0, player:1.0
class_weights = torch.tensor([5.0, 1.0])
```
- **Reason**: Balls have fewer samples than players (170 vs 869, ratio about 1:5)
- **How it works**: When a ball is missed, the model is penalized 5 times more than when a player is missed
- **Expectation**: The model will "try harder" to find and detect balls

2. Adjust loss weights
```python
box=10.0,  # Increased from 7.5 to 10.0
cls=2.0,  # Increased from 0.5 to 2.0
```
- **Box loss**: Increased to make the model focus more on accurate object positioning, especially for small objects
- **Class loss**: Increased to make the model recognize classes more accurately (stronger "penalty" when the model misclassifies or misses any object)

3. Improve augmentation for small objects
```python
scale=0.7,      # Increased from 0.5
mixup=0.3,      # Newly added
copy_paste=0.1, # Newly added
```
- **Scale**: Increase scale transformation to create more object sizes
- **Mixup**: Mix two images together, helping the model learn features better
- **Copy-paste**: Copy objects from one image to another, especially useful for classes with few samples

4. Increase training time
```python
epochs=80,    # Increased from 50
patience=30,  # Increased from 15
```
Give the model more time to learn

### Implementation Process

Script ran until Epoch 66/80 then reported error: 
```
RuntimeError: MPS backend out of memory (MPS allocated: 12.13 GB, other allocations: 5.81 GB, max allowed: 18.13 GB). Tried to allocate 200.00 MB on private pool. Use PYTORCH_MPS_HIGH_WATERMARK_RATIO=0.0 to disable upper limit for memory allocations (may cause system failure).
```

This error occurs when the GPU runs out of memory during training:
- **MPS allocated**: 12.13 GB
- **Other allocations**: 5.81 GB 
- **Total limit**: 18.13 GB
- When trying to allocate an additional 200 MB, the system could not handle it

Model evaluation analysis:

1. Started detecting balls!
- **Before**: mAP50 = 0.000 (could not detect balls)
- **Now**: mAP50 = 0.0562 (started detecting)

2. Detailed analysis by class:

| Class | Precision | Recall | mAP50 | mAP50-95 |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------|----------|
| Ball | 0.765 | 0.0412 | 0.0562 | 0.0168 |
| Player | 0.891 | 0.960 | 0.974 | 0.689 |
| Overall | 0.828 | 0.500 | 0.515 | 0.353 |

- **Strengths**: When the model detects a ball, the accuracy is quite good (Precision = 0.765)
- **Main limitation**: Ball detection rate is still low (Recall = 0.0412), only finding about 4% of balls

### Experiment Overview

6 different experiments:

1. **Baseline**: YOLOv11n, imgsz=640, default parameters
2. **Model S**: Upgraded to YOLOv11s, keeping other parameters constant
3. **Imgsz 1280**: Increased image size from 640 to 1280, reduced batch size
4. **High Loss**: Increased box and cls loss weights to improve detection
5. **Combined**: Combined larger model (YOLOv11s) + larger images (1280) + increased loss
6. **Custom**: Used largest model (YOLOv11m), large images, increased loss and epochs

### Detailed Analysis

#### Ball Detection
Ball detection is the biggest challenge in this project:

| Experiment | Ball mAP50 | Ball Recall | Ball Precision |
|------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| 0_baseline | 0.148      | 0.117       | 0.609          |
| 1_model_s  | 0.205      | 0.101       | 0.964          |
| 2_imgsz_1280| 0.400     | 0.337       | 0.901          |
| 3_high_loss| 0.179      | 0.118       | 0.818          |
| 4_combined | 0.574      | 0.419       | 0.967          |
| custom     | 0.598      | 0.459       | 0.932          |

**Observations on ball detection**:
- Increasing image size (1280) had the most positive impact on ball detection, raising mAP50 from ~0.15 to 0.40
- Combining larger models (YOLOv11s/YOLOv11m) with larger images and increased loss weights gave the best results
- The custom experiment with YOLOv11m and more epochs achieved the best results (mAP50 = 0.598)

#### Player Detection
Player detection was relatively easier and achieved good results from the baseline:

| Experiment | Player mAP50 | Player Recall | Player Precision |
|------------|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| 0_baseline | 0.957        | 0.928         | 0.860            |
| 1_model_s  | 0.972        | 0.891         | 0.974            |
| 2_imgsz_1280| 0.962       | 0.922         | 0.880            |
| 3_high_loss| 0.955        | 0.926         | 0.853            |
| 4_combined | 0.992        | 0.982         | 0.981            |
| custom     | 0.993        | 0.989         | 0.983            |

**Observations on player detection**:
- From the baseline, player detection was already very good (mAP50 = 0.957)
- Combining larger models and larger images in experiments 4 and custom helped improve to over 0.99

#### Overall Performance

| Experiment | mAP50 | mAP50-95 | Training Time |
|------------|-------|----------|---------------|
| 0_baseline | 0.553 | 0.339    | 0.149 hours (~9 min)  |
| 1_model_s  | 0.588 | 0.411    | 0.177 hours (~11 min) |
| 2_imgsz_1280| 0.694| 0.527    | 0.341 hours (~20 min) |
| 3_high_loss| 0.567 | 0.346    | 0.147 hours (~9 min)  |
| 4_combined | 0.783 | 0.609    | 0.586 hours (~35 min) |
| custom     | 0.796 | 0.652    | 2.642 hours (~2h38m)  |

### Evaluation and Conclusion

#### General Assessment
1. **Impact of image size**: Increasing image size from 640 to 1280 brought the biggest improvement, especially for ball detection. This makes sense since the ball is a small object in the frame.

2. **Impact of model**: YOLOv11s and YOLOv11m gave better results than YOLOv11n, but with increased training time.

3. **Impact of loss weights**: Increasing box and cls loss weights (from 7.5/0.5 to 10.0/3.0) had a positive impact when combined with larger models and larger image sizes.

4. **Performance vs. time trade-off**: The "custom" experiment gave the best results but took almost 5 times longer than the "4_combined" experiment while only improving mAP50 from 0.783 to 0.796.

#### Conclusion

- If prioritizing speed: Use configuration from "2_imgsz_1280" experiment (YOLOv11n with imgsz=1280)
- If prioritizing quality and have time: Use configuration from "4_combined" experiment (YOLOv11s with imgsz=1280, box=10.0, cls=3.0)
