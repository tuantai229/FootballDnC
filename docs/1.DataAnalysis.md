### General Statistics
- **Number of training videos**: 5
- **Number of test videos**: 2
- **Total videos**: 7
- **Videos with annotation files**: 6 (1 training video has no JSON file)
- **Video dimensions**: 3840 x 1200 pixels
- **Frame rate**: 25 fps
- **Duration of each video**: 1 minute (~1500 frames)

## JSON File Structure Analysis

### Main Components
1. **Licenses**: Copyright information
2. **Info**: Dataset description information
3. **Categories**: List of object types
   - id: 1, name: field
   - id: 2, name: bystander
   - id: 3, name: ball
   - id: 4, name: player
4. **Images**: Information about frames
   - id: Frame ID
   - width: Width (3840)
   - height: Height (1200)
   - file_name: File name (frame_XXXXXX.PNG)
5. **Annotations**: Information about objects in each frame
   - id: Annotation ID
   - image_id: ID of the frame containing the object
   - category_id: Object type (1, 2, 3, 4)
   - area: Area of the bounding box
   - bbox: Bounding box coordinates [x, y, width, height]
   - attributes: 
     - With category_id=3 - ball
       + object_ID: Ball's identification ID
       + flying: true/false
       + ID_of_player: none
       + goal: false
       + occluded: Whether the ball is occluded (occluded/no_occluded)
     - With category_id=4 - player
       + object_ID: Player's identification ID
       + facing_side: Player's viewing direction
       + jersey_number: Player's jersey number
       + team_jersey_color: Team color (white/black)
       + occluded: Whether the player is occluded (occluded/no_occluded/fully_occluded/highly_occluded/partially_occluded)
       + number_visible: Whether the jersey number is visible (visible/invisible/partially_visible)

## Player Characteristics Analysis

### Jersey Number Analysis
- Numbers 1-10 appear more frequently than other numbers
- In many cases, jersey numbers may not be clearly visible ('invisible')
- Suggested jersey number classification:
  + Class 0: Unclear jersey number
  + Class 1-10: For numbers 1 through 10
  + Class 11: For numbers 11 and above

### Jersey Color Analysis
- Only 2 types of jersey colors: white and black
- Can be used to distinguish teams

## Challenges and Plans

### Challenges
1. Large video dimensions (3840x1200), requires efficient processing
2. Multiple player objects may appear in a single frame
3. Jersey numbers may not be clearly visible in many cases
4. Jersey number distribution may be uneven

### Plans for Object Detection
1. Extract individual frames from videos
2. Filter to keep only player (category_id=4) and ball (category_id=3) annotations
3. Convert from COCO format to YOLO format
4. May need to resize images to smaller dimensions to speed up training

### Plans for Image Classification
1. Crop player images based on bounding boxes
2. Filter out cases where jersey numbers are not visible during training
3. Balance the data to ensure each class has sufficient samples
4. Need to create an additional class for 'invisible jersey number'
5. May use data augmentation to enhance the dataset

### Plans for Bonus Task
1. Design a model with 2 heads: one for jersey number, one for jersey color
2. Or design a multi-label model with (n+2) classes:
   - n classes for jersey numbers (0-10, 11+)
   - 2 classes for jersey colors (white, dark)

## Next Steps

1. Write a script to extract frames from videos
2. Write a script to convert annotations from COCO to YOLO format
3. Prepare data for Object Detection training
