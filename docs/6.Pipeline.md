# Pipeline recognizing and classifying player jersey numbers

## 1. Process
1. **Input:** Test video + 2 trained models
2. **Detection:** Detect players and balls in each frame
3. **Classification:** Classify jersey numbers and jersey colors of each detected player
4. **Visualization:** Display the results with bounding boxes and appropriate labels
5. **Output:** Video with annotations

## 2. Implementation steps

### Step 1: Input video processing
- Read test video using OpenCV
- Extract each frame (some frames can be skipped to increase processing speed, for example, take 1 frame every 3 frames)
- Resize frame if needed (depending on the size of the trained object detection model)

### Step 2: Detect player and ball
- Load model object detection (YOLOv11)
- For each frame:
  - Convert frame to YOLO-compatible format (resize, normalize)
  - Perform inference to detect player and ball
  - Filter results based on confidence threshold (e.g. 0.3)
  - Save bounding box, class (player/ball), confidence score

### Step 3: Classify jersey number and jersey color
- Load model classification (ResNet50)
- For each player bounding box:
  - Crop the player image from the original frame
  - Resize crop to appropriate size (224x224 for ResNet50)
  - Normalize according to mean/std used during training
  - Perform inference to get prediction of jersey number and jersey color
  - Save predicted jersey number and jersey color information

### Step 4: Display the result
- For each processed frame:
  - Draw bounding box for both player and ball (use different colors)
  - For player:
    - Draw bounding box
    - Write jersey number above bounding box
    - Set text color to match team color
  - For ball:
    - Draw bounding box

### Step 5: Create the resulting video
- Initialize VideoWriter with the same fps, size as the original video
- Write each processed frame to the new video
- Close the file when finished

1. **src/pipeline/main.py**: Main file to run the entire pipeline
2. **src/pipeline/video_utils.py**: Functions related to video processing (read, write, extract frames)
3. **src/pipeline/detector.py**: Wrapper for model object detection
4. **src/pipeline/classifier.py**: Wrapper for model classification
5. **src/pipeline/visualizer.py**: Functions to draw results on frames
